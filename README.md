# PythonPackagesUpdater

This Python Script updates the PIP Module and then all outdated pip modules automatically using the call and check_output methods from the subprocess module, which enables python to run commands
directly from code and get execution output (check_output).

This script is usefull when dealing with a lot of packages that requires to be updated and want to save time while dealing with this task.

NOTE: Some pip modules have specific and strict dependences which are required to be able to run and work correctly, be careful with this and avoid breaking some packages.
